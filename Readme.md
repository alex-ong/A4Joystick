I cant remember which version. it's probably 2.0 or master.
You copy it into your arduino installation folder somewhere 
```
Installation Instructions
Copy the Joystick folder to the Arduino libraries folder. Once the folder has been copied, the Joystick library should appear in the Arduino IDE list of libraries. The examples should also appear in the examples menu in the Arduino IDE.

Microsoft Windows
On Microsoft Windows machines, this is typically %userprofile%\Documents\Arduino\libraries. The deploy.bat file can be executed to install the Joystick folder on Microsoft Windows machines (assuming a default Arduino installation).
```

2) Open the .ino file
3) modify .ino file for ports to be right
4) compile and enjoy
